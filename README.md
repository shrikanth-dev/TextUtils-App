The page will reload on changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing for best performance.\
